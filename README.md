This is a Docker environment for developing Zephyr applications. The Dockerfile is based on the setup by Shawn Hymel from his tutorial series for Zephyr on the DigiKey YouTube channel. This version includes the installation of more toolchains and dependencies. It is also set up in a way that the remote user is not root, but can still run all the required commands. As I'm using this setup, I probably will encounter more things to add here, but so far it has worked.
