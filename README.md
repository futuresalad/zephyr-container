This is a docker environment for developing Zephyr applications. The Dockerfile is based on the setup by Shawn Hymel from his tutorial series for Zephyr on the DigiKey YouTube channel. The Dockerfile includes the installation of more toolchains and dependencies.
It is also set up in a way so the remote user is not root but still can run all the commands. As im using this setup, i probably will encounter more things to add here but so far it worked.
